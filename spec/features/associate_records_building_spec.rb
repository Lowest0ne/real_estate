feature 'associate records building',%Q{
  As a real estate associate
  I want to record a building
  So that I can refer back to pertinent information
}do

# Acceptance Criteria:
#
# * I must specify a street address, city, state, and postal code
# * Only US states can be specified
# * I can optionally specify a description of the building
# * If I enter all of the required information in the required format, the building is recorded.
# * If I do not specify all of the required information in the required formats, the building is not recorded and I am presented with errors
# * Upon successfully creating a building, I am redirected so that I can record another building.

#  Also
#
# * When recording a building, I want to optionally associate the building with its rightful owner.
# * If I delete an owner, the owner and its primary key should no longer be associated with any properties.
